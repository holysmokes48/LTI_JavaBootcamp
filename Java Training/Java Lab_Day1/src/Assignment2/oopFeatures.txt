a. Identify the attributes of the Student class. What are the details that can be exposed and what details can be hidden?

Exposed Details:
- Residential Status
- whether student is grad or post-grad
- total number of Students
- engineering department


Hidden Details:
- student ID
- Student Name
- Hostel Number
- Room Number
- Fees
- Automated System Login Id
- Automated System Password
- student grades
- student attendance





b. Consider the calculation of grade for the Student. There are several student types. Let us assume that we need to write a method for the calculation. How many methods would be written? Will they have the same name and signature? Will the functionality /code in these functions remain same? 

Letter Grade (A-F or Pass/Fail Option)
GPA 		(weighted or unweighted 4.0 scale)
Number Grade (0-100)

Based on the category of grades, there would be at least 3 groups of methods for calculation. The ones that share similar functionalities will most likely be use function overloading.





c. The fees have to be paid by the host-elite and by the day scholars. The host-elites need to pay hostel fees along with semester fees. The day scholars need to pay only semester fees. How many function/s would you code in the Student class and why?

I would write 2 functions since the calculation of total fees depends on the residential status of the student. 




d. For the options a,b and c identify the OOP features that would be implemented


A) Encapsulation
B) Inheritance, Polymorphism
C)Polymorphism
